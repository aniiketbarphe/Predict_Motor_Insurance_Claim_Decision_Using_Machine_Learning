# Predict_Motor_Insurance_Claim_Decision_Using_Machine_Learning

**1) About Problem:-**

The Vehicle Insurance business is a multi-billion dollar industry. Every year millions and millions of premiums are paid, and a huge amount of claims also pile up. 

You have to step into the shoes of a data scientist who is building models to help an insurance company understand which claims are worth rejecting and the claims which should be accepted for reimbursement. 

You are given a rich dataset consisting of thousands of rows of past records, which you can use to learn more about your customersâ€™ behaviours. For example, you are supposed to create an ML model to look at a case of an insurance claim and decide whether to reject or accept it. 

**2) Dataset:-**

Columns: 

['ID', 'AGE', 'GENDER', 'DRIVING_EXPERIENCE', 'EDUCATION', 'INCOME','CREDIT_SCORE', 'VEHICLE_OWNERSHIP', 'VEHICLE_YEAR', 'MARRIED','CHILDREN', 'POSTAL_CODE', 'ANNUAL_MILEAGE', 'SPEEDING_VIOLATIONS','DUIS', 'PAST_ACCIDENTS', 'OUTCOME', 'TYPE_OF_VEHICLE']

 Learn and predict the **OUTCOME** variable.
